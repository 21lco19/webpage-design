							Black hat hackers are cybercriminals that illegally crack systems with
							malicious intent. Seeking
							to gain unauthorized access to computer systems is the definition of
							black hat hacking. Once a
							black hat hacker finds a security vulnerability, they try to exploit it,
							often by implanting a
							virus or other type of malware such as a trojan.

							Ransomware attacks are another favored ploy that black hat hackers use to
							extort financial gains
							or breach data systems.

						Also known as “white hats,” ethical hackers are security experts that
						perform these security
						assessments. The proactive work they do helps to improve an organization’s
						security posture. With
						prior approval from the organization or owner of the IT asset, the mission
						of ethical hacking is
						opposite from malicious hacking.
						Penetration Testing: A Buyer's Guide

						This guide details the benefits of pen testing, what to look for in a pen
						testing solution, and
						questions to ask potential vendors.
						Download the guide
						What are the key concepts of ethical hacking?

						Hacking experts follow four key protocol concepts:

						Stay legal. Obtain proper approval before accessing and performing a
						security assessment.
						Define the scope. Determine the scope of the assessment so that the
						ethical hacker’s work remains
						legal and within the organization’s approved boundaries.
						Report vulnerabilities. Notify the organization of all vulnerabilities
						discovered during the
						assessment. Provide remediation advice for resolving these
						vulnerabilities.
						Respect data sensitivity. Depending on the data sensitivity, ethical
						hackers may have to agree to a
						non-disclosure agreement, in addition to other terms and conditions
						required by the assessed
						organization.

				<div class="r2">
					<p id="p3">A red hat hacker is a hacker who takes aggressive steps to stop black hat hackers. While red hat hackers are not inherently evil, they do everything they can to stop the bad guys, including taking matters into their own hands. They go to the lengths of launching full-scale attacks to take down cybercriminals’ or cyber attackers’ servers and destroy their resources.

						Red hat hackers are often dubbed the Robin Hoods of the virtual world. Like the heroic outlaw, they are not opposed to stealing back what the cybercriminals or cyber attackers stole from their victims. And like Robin Hood and his Merry Men, they won’t keep the stolen goods for themselves. Instead, they will give them back to their owners.</p>
